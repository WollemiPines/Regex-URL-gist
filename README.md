## Regex Components

### Anchors
The regex expression used to match URL's...
 `/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/`
...uses anchors on either end to define what charaters URL's typically begin or end with.

### Quantifiers

There are a number of quantifiers used in this regular expression. 
Qunatifiers can be used in a similar way of and/or gates. They can allow the programer to write a regex that can specify: 
* - zero-or-more
+ - one-or-more
? - zero-or-one
{4} - a specific quantity such as four 
{4,} - more than four 
{1,4} - or between one and three
